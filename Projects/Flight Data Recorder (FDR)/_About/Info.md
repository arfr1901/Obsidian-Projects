This vault contains documentation of a project that involves the development of a miniature flight data recorder (FDR) or "black box" using a Raspberry Pi or Arduino.

### Components Needed:
- Raspberry Pi or Arduino
- Various sensors (IMU for accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, barometer for altitude, GPS module)
- MicroSD card module for data storage
- Real-time clock (RTC) module for timestamping
- Power supply (battery or power bank)
- Optional: Small display (OLED or LCD) for real-time data visualization

### Skills Demonstrated:
- Embedded Systems Programming: Proficiency in C/C++ or Python for interfacing with sensors and handling data.
- Sensor Integration: Understanding of various sensors and their communication protocols.
- Data Acquisition and Logging: Techniques for efficiently logging and storing data.
- Real-Time Systems: Basics of real-time data processing and display.
- Power Management: Design considerations for low-power, long-duration operation.
- Data Analysis: Ability to analyze and visualize collected data.
- Documentation and Presentation: Effective communication of technical details and project outcomes.
