# OpenWings Flight Simulator

## Project Description:
OpenWings Flight Simulator aims to create a realistic flight simulation experience focusing on accuracy in physics, a variety of aircraft models, and a detailed environment. The project will be open-source, allowing contributions from the community to enhance features and add new content.

## Key Features:
### Realistic Flight Physics:
- Implement realistic aerodynamics and flight dynamics.
- Simulate different weather conditions and their impact on flight.

### Diverse Aircraft Models:
- Include a variety of aircraft from small private planes to large commercial jets.
- Develop detailed cockpits with interactive instruments.

### Detailed Environments:
- Create realistic airports with functional runways and taxiways.
- Develop varied terrains including cities, mountains, and oceans.

### Multiplayer Mode:
- Allow users to fly together in a shared environment.
- Implement air traffic control (ATC) for a more immersive experience.

### Modular Design:
- Use a modular architecture to allow easy addition of new aircraft, environments, and features.
- Support community-made mods and plugins.

## Technology Stack:
### Programming Languages:
- C++ for core simulation engine.
- Python for scripting and extensions.
- JavaScript and HTML for the user interface.

### Graphics and Rendering:
- OpenGL or Vulkan for rendering graphics.
- Blender for creating 3D models of aircraft and environments.

### Physics Engine:
- Bullet Physics for realistic aerodynamics and collision detection.

### Networking:
- WebSocket or similar protocols for multiplayer capabilities.

### Development Tools:
- Git for version control.
- CMake for build automation.
- Visual Studio or JetBrains CLion for IDE.
