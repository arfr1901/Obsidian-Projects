Adaptive step size control adjusts the time step size during numerical integration to balance accuracy and computational cost. The idea is to use smaller time steps when the solution changes rapidly and larger steps when the solution varies slowly.

A simple adaptive step size control strategy is based on the local error estimate. For instance, using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we can estimate the local error and adjust the step size accordingly:

$$
\Delta t_{\text{new}} = \Delta t \left( \frac{\epsilon \cdot \Delta t}{\text{error}} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}
$$

where $\epsilon$ is a tolerance parameter and $\text{error}$ is the estimated local error.
