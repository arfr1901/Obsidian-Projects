The equations of motion for the two-body problem can be described as:

$$
\mathbf{a}_1 = G \frac{m_2}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}

\ \ \ and\ \ \

\mathbf{a}_2 = G \frac{m_1}{r^2} (-\hat{\mathbf{r}})
$$


where $\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\mathbf{a}_2$ are the accelerations of the two bodies, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses, and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector in the direction from one body to the other.
