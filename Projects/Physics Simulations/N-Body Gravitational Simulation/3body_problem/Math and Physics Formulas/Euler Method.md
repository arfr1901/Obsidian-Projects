The position and velocity of the bodies are updated using numerical integration methods. For the Euler method, the update equations are:

$$
\mathbf{v}(t + \Delta t) = \mathbf{v}(t) + \mathbf{a}(t) \Delta t
$$
$$
\mathbf{r}(t + \Delta t) = \mathbf{r}(t) + \mathbf{v}(t) \Delta t
$$

where $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity, $\mathbf{a}$ is the acceleration, $\mathbf{r}$ is the position, and $\Delta t$ is the time step.

For the Runge-Kutta method, the equations are more complex and provide higher accuracy.
