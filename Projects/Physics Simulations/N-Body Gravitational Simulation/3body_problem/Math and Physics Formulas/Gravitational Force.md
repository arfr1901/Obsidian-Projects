Newton's law of gravitation states that the force between two bodies is given by:

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \tag{1}
$$
where:

- **F** is the gravitational force.
- **G** is the gravitational constant.
- **m<sub>1</sub>** and **m<sub>2</sub>** are the masses of the two bodies.
- **r** is the distance between the centers of the two bodies.
