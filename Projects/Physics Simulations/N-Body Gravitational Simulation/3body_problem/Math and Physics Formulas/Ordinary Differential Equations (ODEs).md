An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an equation containing a function of one independent variable and its derivatives. In the context of the two-body problem, the ODEs describe the motion of the bodies under gravitational forces. The general form is:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \mathbf{v}
$$
$$
\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \mathbf{a}
$$

where $\mathbf{r}$ is the position, $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity, and $\mathbf{a}$ is the acceleration.
