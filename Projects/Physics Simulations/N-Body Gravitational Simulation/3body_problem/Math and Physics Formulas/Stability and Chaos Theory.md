The three-body problem is known for its sensitivity to initial conditions, a hallmark of chaotic systems. Understanding the stability of orbits and the onset of chaos requires analyzing how small perturbations in initial conditions can lead to vastly different trajectories.

A useful tool for this analysis is the Lyapunov exponent, which measures the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories:

$$
\lambda = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \ln \frac{d(t)}{d(0)}
$$

where $d(t)$ is the separation between two trajectories at time $t$.
