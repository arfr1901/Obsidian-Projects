#### [[1. Differential Calculus]]
- **Equations of Motion**: The core of simulating the three-body problem involves solving differential equations that describe how the positions and velocities of the bodies change over time.
- **Newtonâ€™s Laws**: These laws are expressed as differential equations, which require differentiation to determine forces, velocities, and accelerations.

#### [[2. Integral Calculus]]
- **Numerical Integration**: Integral calculus is crucial for numerical methods used to solve differential equations. Methods like Runge-Kutta involve integration steps to update positions and velocities.
- **Energy Calculations**: Calculating potential and kinetic energy over time involves integration, especially when dealing with varying forces.

#### [[3. Multivariable Calculus]]
- **Vector Calculations**: The positions and velocities of bodies in space are represented as vectors. Multivariable calculus is essential for handling these vector fields and understanding how they change in three-dimensional space.
- **Gradient and Divergence**: Concepts like the gradient of a potential field and the divergence of a vector field are important for understanding forces and energy distributions.

#### [[6. Linear Algebra]]
- **Matrix Operations**: Useful for transformations and handling multiple equations simultaneously.
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: In the context of stability analysis.
    
#### [[4. Classical Mechanics]]
- **Conservation Laws**: Ensuring energy and momentum conservation in your calculations.

#### [[5. Orbital Mechanics]]
- **Kepler's Laws**: Understanding elliptical orbits and applying these laws to predict motion.
- **Orbital Elements**: Defining the parameters of orbits.

#### [[7. Mathematical Statistics]]
- **Error Analysis**: Numerical methods introduce errors, and statistical techniques are used to analyze and minimize these errors. Understanding the distribution and propagation of errors is crucial for ensuring the accuracy of simulations.
- **Monte Carlo Methods**: These are used for simulating and understanding the behavior of systems with probabilistic elements or for performing sensitivity analysis on initial conditions.
- **Data Analysis**: After running simulations, statistical methods are used to analyze the results, identify patterns, and make predictions.
