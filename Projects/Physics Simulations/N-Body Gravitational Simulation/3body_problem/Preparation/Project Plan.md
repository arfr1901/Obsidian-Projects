W#### Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Research and Understand Basics**
    - Study Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation.
    - Review numerical methods for solving differential equations, focusing on the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods.
    
2. **Setup Development Environment**
    - Choose a development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, CLion).
    - Install necessary libraries (e.g., Eigen for linear algebra, SFML for visualization).

#### Phase 2: Iterative Software Design

3. **Define Software Architecture**
    - **UML Diagrams:**
        - Create Use Case Diagrams to understand the interactions with the system.
        - Develop Class Diagrams to define the structure and relationships between different components.
        - Use Sequence Diagrams to outline the flow of operations.
        
4. **Apply SOLID Principles**
    - **Single Responsibility Principle:**
        - Ensure each class has a single responsibility.
    - **Open/Closed Principle:**
        - Design classes that are open for extension but closed for modification.
    - **Liskov Substitution Principle:**
        - Ensure subclasses can replace base classes without affecting the program.
    - **Interface Segregation Principle:**
        - Create specific interfaces rather than a general-purpose one.
    - **Dependency Inversion Principle:**
        - Depend on abstractions, not on concrete classes.

#### Phase 3: Initial Implementation

5. **Define Data Structures**
    - Implement classes for celestial bodies, encapsulating properties like mass, position, and velocity.
    
6. **Implement Basic Physics**
    - Apply the formulas for gravitational force and acceleration.
    - Develop functions for updating position and velocity using the Euler method.
    
7. **Create a Basic Simulation Loop**
    - Construct a loop that updates the positions and velocities over time.
    - Test with simple cases to ensure accuracy.

#### Phase 4: Refinement and Accuracy

8. **Improve Numerical Methods**
    - Implement the Runge-Kutta method for better accuracy.
    - Compare results with the Euler method to gauge improvements.
    
9. **Handle Edge Cases**
    - Implement collision detection and response mechanisms.
    - Address singularities and small distance scenarios.
    
10. **Validate the Model**
    - Compare simulation results with real-world data (e.g., Moon's orbit around the Earth).

#### Phase 5: Visualization and Analysis

11. **Add Basic Visualization (Week 7-8)**
    - Integrate SFML to graphically represent the bodies.
    - Display the trajectories as points or simple shapes.
    
12. **Enhance Visualization (Week 9-10)**
    - Improve the graphical interface with animations.
    - Add features like zooming, panning, and real-time data display.
    
13. **Analyze Results**
    - Plot and verify quantities like energy and momentum conservation.
    - Test different initial conditions to observe various orbital behaviors.

#### Phase 6: Documentation and Extension

14. **Document the Code**
    - Write comprehensive documentation for classes, methods, and overall architecture.
    - Include comments and detailed explanations within the code.
    
15. **Extend the Project**
    - Introduce additional celestial bodies (e.g., Sun, Earth, and Moon system).
    - Explore more complex scenarios or enhance the physics model (e.g., relativistic effects).
