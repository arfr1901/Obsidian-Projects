### Predictability of the Three-Body Problem
**Short-Term Predictability**:
- Initially, the positions and movements of the celestial bodies can be predicted with high accuracy using numerical methods.
- Given precise initial conditions and a robust numerical integration method (e.g., Runge-Kutta), short-term trajectories can be computed accurately.
    
**Long-Term Predictability**:
- Over time, small errors in initial conditions or numerical approximations can grow exponentially, leading to significant deviations in predicted trajectories.
- This sensitivity to initial conditions is a hallmark of chaotic systems, making long-term predictions increasingly uncertain. This is the core problem being explored.
