### Types of Machine Learning Models:
1. **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms are trained on labeled data. Common methods include:
    - **Linear Regression**: For predicting a continuous variable.
    - **Logistic Regression**: For classification problems.
    - **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: For classification and regression.
    - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: For classification and regression.
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: For classification and regression.
    
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms are used to find patterns in data without labeled responses. Common methods include:
    - **K-Means Clustering**: For grouping data into clusters.
    - **Hierarchical Clustering**: For creating a tree of clusters.
    - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: For dimensionality reduction.
    
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms learn by interacting with an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.
    
4. **Neural Networks**: These are a subset of machine learning models inspired by the human brain's structure. They can have varying architectures:
    - **Simple Neural Networks**: These might have just one or two layers (often referred to as shallow networks).
    - **Deep Neural Networks**: These have multiple hidden layers and form the basis of deep learning. Examples include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data.
