# Simulate a Satellite Communication Link Using MATLAB/Simulink

## Objective:
To simulate a basic satellite communication link, including signal transmission, propagation effects, and reception, using MATLAB/Simulink.

## Requirements:
- **MATLAB/Simulink Software**: Ensure you have access to MATLAB and the necessary toolboxes (Communications System Toolbox, Satellite Communications Toolbox, Simulink).
- **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with MATLAB/Simulink and fundamental concepts of satellite communications.

## Steps:

### Project Setup:
1. Install MATLAB and Simulink if not already installed.
2. Open MATLAB and create a new Simulink model.

### Design the Communication Link:

#### Transmitter Block:
- Use a signal generator block to create a baseband signal (e.g., sine wave or modulated data signal).
- Modulate the signal using a modulator block (e.g., QPSK or BPSK modulator).

#### Channel Block:
- Simulate the free-space path loss using a custom function or available blocks.
- Add noise to the channel to simulate real-world conditions (e.g., Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) block).
- Optionally, simulate Doppler shift and other atmospheric effects.

#### Receiver Block:
- Demodulate the received signal using the corresponding demodulator block.
- Use a BER (Bit Error Rate) calculator to evaluate the performance of the communication link.

### Simulate Orbital Dynamics:
1. Create a simple model to simulate the satellite’s orbit using Keplerian elements.
2. Calculate the distance between the ground station and the satellite over time to adjust the path loss dynamically.

### Visualization:
- Use scopes and displays to visualize the transmitted and received signals.
- Plot the BER against different SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) values to analyze the performance.

### Experimentation:
- Change parameters such as modulation schemes, noise levels, and orbital parameters to see their effects on communication quality.
- Add additional features like error correction codes to improve the robustness of the link.

### Documentation:
- Document each step of your project, including screenshots of your Simulink model, plots, and a description of your findings.

## Example Simulink Model:

### Transmitter Block:
- Signal Generator → Modulator (e.g., BPSK)

### Channel Block:
- Path Loss Model → AWGN Block

### Receiver Block:
- Demodulator → BER Calculator

### Visualization:
- Scope blocks to view signals and BER results.

## Additional Ideas:
- **Satellite Constellations**: Simulate a constellation of satellites (e.g., Starlink) and analyze the coverage.
- **Advanced Modulation Techniques**: Implement and compare advanced modulation techniques (e.g., QAM, OFDM).
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Integrate hardware like SDR (Software-Defined Radio) for real-time simulation and experimentation.
